# FileZilla Upload Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Folders with square brackets [locale] cannot be created via FileZilla
# 
# After uploading via FileZilla, manually rename folders on the server:
# - Rename any folder containing [locale] to remove brackets
# - Or use WinSCP/RSYNC instead which handles special characters better
#
# Example: If you see [locale] folder, rename it to locale or use the actual locale code
